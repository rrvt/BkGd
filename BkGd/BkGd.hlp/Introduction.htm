<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Windows provides for an application to place pictures on the screen as a background.  Their in house 
version of a slide show will only place pictures on the background from one directory.  Furthermore there
does not seem to be a way to determine the path to the current picture on the screen.
</p>
<p>
BkGd attempts to extend the capability of the wallpaper background slide show by providing these services:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Initiates during the login of a user</li>
<li>
  Uses every picture file in a tree of directories given by a single root directory specified by the user
</li>
<li>Allows the user to discover the path to the current picture</li>
<li>Allows the user to specify the interval between changing the background picutre (n minutes)</li>
<li>Allows the user to specify that the pictures are selected randomly or linerly</li>
<li>Allows the user to halt the changing of the wallpaper</li>
</ul>
<p>
The interval and picture directory may be changed at any time. The pictures are randomly or linerly selected.
</p>
<p>
The available operations are described on the <a href="Operations.htm">operations page.</a>.
</p>

<h2>Windows Setup</h2>
<p>
Windows must be setup to accept pictures in the background.  In Windows 11 click your way to
Setup/Personalization/Background and choose "Picture" for the "Personalize your background" setting.
Choose "Fit" for "Choose a fit for your desktop image".  Actually one might experiment with this 
chose but I've found that "Fit" seems best.
</p>
<p>
Other Window OSes probably have similar settings.

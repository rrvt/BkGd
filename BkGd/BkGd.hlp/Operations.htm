This application is composed of two processes:
<ul>
<li>BkGd -- The User Interface Process, accepts the commands below and sends them to BkGDEx</li>
<li>BkGdEx -- The Wallpaper Changer Process, it begins running if enabled at login  or when BkGd sends a command. If not enabled it immediately exits (stops running).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Tool Bar Commands</h2>
<h3><img src="Images/Eye.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Get Current Wallpaper Picture Path</h3>
<p>
Displays:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Picture Root Path</li>
<li>Number of wallpaper files found</li>
<li>Wallpaper change interval</li>
<li>Selection mode, random or linear</li>
<li>Previous wallpaper picture full path</li>
<li>Current wallpaper picture path</li>
<li>Array index of current wallpaper picture</li>
</ul>

<p>
The current picture used as wallpaper is copied to the clip board (useful for
pasting the path into a file manaager or text editor).  Both the previous and current 
picture paths may be selected (mouse to the path and press left mouse button).  Once 
selected the path will be highlighted.  The a right mouse click will yield a popup
menu with a copy command that will put the path into the clip board.
</p>
<p>
The Get Current Wallpaper Picture Path is executed when the app is started and thus the 
current picture path is in the clip board.
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/Next.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Next Wallpaper</h3>
<p>
If the wallpaper changer is disabled, nothing is done (except for a message buried in the 
middle of the text in the app window).  If enabled but not running, the wallpaper changer 
is started.  A message is sent to the wallpaper changer to display the next picture.
</p>

<h3>
  <img src="Images/FileTree.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="FileTree">
  Select Root Picture Directory
</h3>
<p>A Directory Dialog Box is presented to the user.  The resulting path is presented to the Wallpaper
changer (starting it if necessary).
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/ElapsedTime.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Select Interval</h3>
<p>
A dialog box is presented to the user in which to supply the number of minutes to wait before changing
the wallpaper.  The resulting value is presented to the wallpaper changer (starting it if necessary).
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/Mode.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Toggle Selection Mode</h3>
<p>
There are two modes, random selection of picture to use for the wallpaper and
linear selection of the next picture to use for the wallpaper.  This command toggles between the two modes
and notifies the Wallpaper Changer that the mode has changed.
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/Printer.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Print</h3>
<p>
Will do all the normal things to print the content of the window.
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/Options.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Options</h3>
<p>
The options dialog allows specifying the Display and Printer Font Size Scale Factor, the printer
orientation and the printer margins.
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/StopOther.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Stop Changing the Wallpaper</h3>
<p>
Kill the wallpaper changer process (effectively stopping the changing of the wallpaper).
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/About.jpg" width="16" height="15"> About</h3>
<p>
Displays the About Box.  The about box uses text from the resource file (TestApp.rc) for
the output information.  There is a standard about box dialog in the Library.
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/Exit.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Exit</h3>
<p>
Exit the application with no reservations.  Does not stop the wallpaper changer.
</p>

<h2>Mouse Operations</h2>
<p>
The text lines which describe the current and last wallpaper path have a tab after the description 
and before the actual path.  When the mouse cursor is placed anywhere on the path and the left mouse 
button is pressed the path is "selected" and the font colors are inverted (highlighted).  The rule is
the selected part of the line is delimited by a tab character on the left and the end of the line.
</p>
<p>
Selecting a path is only half of the operation.  The selected text must be copied into the clip board.  
This is done in one of the following days:
<ul>
<li>Press Ctrl-C</li>
<li>Select Menu/Edit/Copy</li>
<li>Double Click the left mouse button instead one click</li>
<li>Click the right mouse button and select the Copy command on the Popup Menu</li>
</ul>
</p>
